\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
You have got to check out Fig.~\ref{fig:venn}: it is amazing.

Here is an example citation when you want an author name like \cite{collins2011a} to appear in the text. And here's how to do a parenthetic citation, when you want to mention a reference at the end of a sentence or part of a sentence \citep{collins2013}.

It is possible to cite multiple references at the same time \citep{collins2011b,collins2016,lunn2007a,lunn2007b,ross2006,shannon1948}.
